# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

### Problems I faced:
1. Horizontally centering the box.
2. Settling for a design to use (if the first div should be block and then the second should be flex or if there should be a third).
3. Setting the QR image size.

## **THE SOLUTION?!**
I used the `max-width` property to set the size of the image, which the specific pixels is set in the container. And the image width is just 100%;
